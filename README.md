# Environmental-DS-Project

## Environmental Problem

Our group hopes to look into the expansion of the Saharah Desert over the last few decades, how we can measure it, predict it, and possibly prevent it from spreading in the future. We also would like to look into the project named The Great Green Wall Initiative that went into effect in 2007 and whether that successfully mitigated the expansion and is a viable option to be used in other expansion locations. Our thought process regarding this project is to incorporate a variety of data to classify an area as desert or not, or find pre-established data that contains information regarding the border of the Sahara Desert over a time frame of at least 20-30 years.
