## Environmental Problem

The environmental problem our group is examining is the expansion of the Sahara Desert due to desertification over the past several decades. This process is driven by climate change, declining rainfall, rising temperatures, and unsustainable land use, leading to soil degradation and loss of vegetation. As the desert expands, it threatens ecosystems and the livelihoods of people living in surrounding regions, particularly in the Sahel. 

For local communities, desertification is an immediate threat to food security, water access, and economic stability. Regional governments often frame the issue as a development and security concern, as environmental degradation can contribute to migration and political instability. International organizations and environmental groups tend to frame desertification as a global environmental challenge tied to climate change and biodiversity loss. Ongoing initiatives, such as the Great Green Wall, are possible solutions that address both environmental degradation and human well-being.
